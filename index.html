            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Mario Cuevas, a junior at Clark Atlanta University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with plans to graduate in June 2026. As a student-athlete with experience playing D1 baseball at Coppin State and D2 baseball at Clark Atlanta, I’ve developed exceptional time management and multitasking skills, allowing me to juggle rigorous academic work, athletic commitments, and personal projects effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a strong background in Java, Python, and SQL, and I’m highly skilled in data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. My expertise also extends to web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to design and build interactive, responsive applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professionally, I’ve worked as a Data Software Programming Associate at Be.Brooklyn, where I streamlined payment processes, resolved technical issues, and improved user experiences. These roles strengthened my problem-solving abilities and my capacity to work effectively in teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I’ve created a responsive personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, tutored undergraduate computer science students, and actively participated in coding competitions and volunteer programs. My experiences as a student-athlete and my passion for computer science drive me to secure a summer internship where I can apply my technical skills in SQL, data structures, and cybersecurity while contributing to impactful and innovative projects. I am open to any opportunity and deeply grateful for the chance to contribute. I am eager, driven, and ready to excel in everything I do!
